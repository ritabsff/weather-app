# weather-app

This is an exercise for a course I'm following. 
In this app, you are able to see the weather for the city you are in.
You can also see the weather for the coming 5 days (work in progress).
You will also see the time and day of the week in your current time.

Looking for the weather in another city? 
Search for the name of the city and the information on the page will change.
You will see the time and day of the week of the place you are searching for (work in progress).
